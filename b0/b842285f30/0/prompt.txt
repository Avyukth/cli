go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex

---

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. User's first message: "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex"
2. I launched an Explore agent to understand the agent detection and support architecture
3. While that was running, user sent: "undrstand coding guideline stick to its codeing guidlines, style etc strictly"
4. I then read extensively through the codebase to understand patterns:
   - agent/agent.go - Agent interface
   - agent/registry.go - Agent registration, constants
   - agent/types.go - HookType, HookInput, TokenUsage
   - agent/session.go - AgentSession
   - agent/chunking.go - Transcript chunking
   - claudecode/claude.go - Claude Code agent implementation (full pattern)
   - claudecode/types.go - Claude Code types
   - claudecode/hooks.go - Claude Code hook support
   - geminicli/gemini.go - Gemini CLI agent implementation
   - geminicli/types.go - Gemini CLI types
   - geminicli/hooks.go - Gemini CLI hook support
   - geminicli/transcript.go - Transcript parsing
   - hook_registry.go - Hook handler registration
   - hooks_cmd.go - Hook command generation
   - hooks_claudecode_handlers.go - Claude Code hook handlers
   - hooks_geminicli_handlers.go - Gemini CLI hook handlers
   - setup.go - Enable/disable commands
   - .golangci.yaml - Linter config

5. Researched OpenCode and Codex CLI via two parallel agents
6. Entered plan mode, created detailed plan
7. User approved plan
8. Started implementation:
   - Added constants to registry.go ✓
   - Created opencode/ package (opencode.go, types.go, opencode_test.go) ✓
   - Created codex/ package (codex.go, types.go, hooks.go, codex_test.go) ✓
   - Updated hooks_cmd.go imports ✓
   - Updated hook_registry.go imports (added codex import) ✓
   - Still need to: add Codex handler registration in init(), create hooks_codex_handlers.go, update getHookType()

Let me trace exactly where I left off. The last edits were:
1. hooks_cmd.go - added blank imports for codex and opencode
2. hook_registry.go - added import for codex package

I had NOT yet:
- Added the RegisterHookHandler call for Codex in init()
- Created hooks_codex_handlers.go
- Updated getHookType() to include codex hook name
- Run fmt/lint/tests

Task list status:
- Task 1: Add agent constants ✓
- Task 2: Create OpenCode agent package ✓
- Task 3: Create Codex CLI agent package ✓
- Task 4: Wire up hook handlers and imports - IN PROGRESS
- Task 5: Run fmt, lint, and tests - PENDING

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested to "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex" — meaning add two new AI coding agent integrations (OpenCode and OpenAI Codex CLI) to the Entire CLI's plugin-style agent architecture. The user also emphasized "understand coding guidelines, stick to its coding guidelines, style etc strictly" — meaning follow the project's exact patterns (init() self-registration, interface implementation, nolint annotations, t.Parallel() in tests, error handling patterns, etc.).

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Agent plugin architecture**: Agents self-register via `init()` using `agent.Register(name, factory)` in their own packages
   - **Agent interface hierarchy**: Base `Agent` interface (required), optional `HookSupport`, `HookHandler`, `TranscriptAnalyzer`, `TranscriptChunker`, `FileWatcher`
   - **Hook registry pattern**: Handlers registered in `hook_registry.go` init() to avoid circular dependencies (agent packages can't import cli package)
   - **OpenCode**: Open-source AI CLI, config in `.opencode/`, `opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc`, **NO lifecycle hooks**, XDG session storage, Tools: Write/Edit/ApplyPatch/MultiEdit
   - **Codex CLI**: OpenAI's CLI, config in `.codex/config.toml` (TOML), has `notify` hook firing `agent-turn-complete`, JSONL sessions in `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`
   - **No TOML library** in go.mod — Codex hook installation uses simple string-based TOML manipulation
   - **Coding guidelines**: `t.Parallel()` in all tests, `//nolint:gochecknoinits` for init(), `//nolint:revive` for stuttering agent type names, explicit error handling, `golangci-lint` compliance, `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci` before commits

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/registry.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Central registry for agent names and types; added 4 new constants
     ```go
     const (
         AgentNameClaudeCode AgentName = "claude-code"
         AgentNameCodex      AgentName = "codex"
         AgentNameGemini     AgentName = "gemini"
         AgentNameOpenCode   AgentName = "opencode"
     )
     const (
         AgentTypeClaudeCode AgentType = "Claude Code"
         AgentTypeCodex      AgentType = "Codex CLI"
         AgentTypeGemini     AgentType = "Gemini CLI"
         AgentTypeOpenCode   AgentType = "OpenCode"
         AgentTypeUnknown    AgentType = "Agent"
     )
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode.go`** (NEW)
     - Full Agent interface implementation for OpenCode. No HookSupport since OpenCode has no hooks.
     - Key: `SupportsHooks() returns false`, `ParseHookInput() returns error`, DetectPresence checks `.opencode/`, `opencode.json`, `opencode.jsonc`
     - `GetSessionDir` uses XDG_DATA_HOME (`~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/`)
     - `FormatResumeCommand` returns `"opencode run --session " + sessionID`
     - Full file was written (approximately 180 lines)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/types.go`** (NEW)
     - Tool constants: `ToolWrite`, `ToolEdit`, `ToolApplyPatch`, `ToolMultiEdit`
     - `FileModificationTools` slice

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode_test.go`** (NEW)
     - Tests: TestNewOpenCodeAgent, TestName, TestType, TestDescription, TestSupportsHooks_ReturnsFalse, TestParseHookInput_ReturnsError, TestDetectPresence (4 subtests), TestResolveSessionFile, TestProtectedDirs, TestFormatResumeCommand, TestTransformSessionID, TestGetSessionDir
     - DetectPresence tests use `t.Chdir()` so they're NOT parallel (process-global state)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/codex.go`** (NEW)
     - Full Agent, TranscriptAnalyzer, TranscriptChunker implementation for Codex CLI
     - DetectPresence checks `.codex/` dir and `.codex/config.toml`
     - `ParseHookInput` parses JSON notify payload with `thread-id`, `turn-id`, `cwd`, `input-messages`, `last-assistant-message`
     - `GetSessionDir` respects `CODEX_HOME` env var, defaults to `~/.codex/sessions/`
     - `GetTranscriptPosition` and `ExtractModifiedFilesFromOffset` use JSONL line-counting (same pattern as Claude Code)
     - `ChunkTranscript`/`ReassembleTranscript` delegate to `agent.ChunkJSONL`/`agent.ReassembleJSONL`
     - `ExtractModifiedFiles` function parses rollout JSONL for `file_change` items
     - Full file approximately 310 lines

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/types.go`** (NEW)
     - `notifyPayload` struct (JSON from Codex notify)
     - `rolloutEvent`, `rolloutItem` structs for JSONL parsing
     - Constants: `ItemTypeFileChange`, `ItemTypeCommandExecution`, `ItemTypeAgentMessage`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/hooks.go`** (NEW)
     - Implements `HookSupport` and `HookHandler` interfaces
     - Interface assertions: `_ agent.HookSupport = (*CodexAgent)(nil)`, `_ agent.HookHandler = (*CodexAgent)(nil)`
     - Single hook: `HookNameAgentTurnComplete = "agent-turn-complete"`
     - `InstallHooks` reads/writes `.codex/config.toml` using string manipulation (no TOML library)
     - Installs `notify = ["entire", "hooks", "codex", "agent-turn-complete"]` line
     - `AreHooksInstalled` checks for Entire notify line in config
     - Helper functions: `isEntireNotifyLine()`, `appendNotifyLine()`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/codex_test.go`** (NEW)
     - Comprehensive tests covering: agent creation, name/type/description, hooks support, detect presence (3 subtests), parse hook input, resolve session file, protected dirs, resume command, session ID transform, hook names, install/uninstall/areInstalled hooks, session dir, isEntireNotifyLine, ExtractModifiedFiles

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_cmd.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added blank imports for codex and opencode agent packages to ensure registration
     ```go
     _ "github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex"
     _ "github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode"
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hook_registry.go`** (PARTIALLY MODIFIED)
     - Added import: `"github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex"`
     - Still needs: RegisterHookHandler call for Codex in init(), getHookType() update

   - **Files read for reference** (not modified):
     - `agent/agent.go` - Agent interface definition (74 lines, 5 interfaces)
     - `agent/types.go` - HookType, HookInput, SessionChange, TokenUsage
     - `agent/session.go` - AgentSession struct and helpers
     - `agent/chunking.go` - ChunkJSONL, ReassembleJSONL, ChunkTranscript
     - `claudecode/claude.go` - Reference implementation pattern
     - `claudecode/types.go` - Reference types pattern
     - `claudecode/hooks.go` - Reference hook support pattern
     - `geminicli/gemini.go` - Reference implementation pattern
     - `geminicli/types.go` - Reference types pattern
     - `geminicli/hooks.go` - Reference hook support pattern
     - `geminicli/transcript.go` - Reference transcript parsing
     - `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - Reference handler pattern
     - `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` - Reference handler pattern
     - `setup.go` - Enable/disable flow, setupAgentHooksNonInteractive
     - `.golangci.yaml` - Linter configuration
     - `geminicli/gemini_test.go` - Reference test pattern
     - `claudecode/claude_test.go` - Reference test pattern

4. Errors and fixes:
   - No code errors encountered yet (haven't run fmt/lint/tests yet)
   - File path error: tried `.golangci.yml` but actual file is `.golangci.yaml` — corrected immediately
   - Tried to search in `cmd/entire/cli/commands` but that directory doesn't exist — corrected to search in `cmd/entire/cli`

5. Problem Solving:
   - Researched OpenCode and Codex CLI capabilities via web search agents to understand their hook systems, config formats, session storage, and tool names
   - Determined OpenCode has NO hooks → implements only base Agent interface
   - Determined Codex has limited `notify` hook → implements HookSupport with TOML string manipulation (no TOML library dependency needed)
   - Identified that `setupAgentHooksNonInteractive` requires `HookSupport` interface, meaning `entire enable --agent opencode` will return "agent does not support hooks" error

6. All user messages:
   - "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex"
   - "undrstand coding guideline stick to its codeing guidlines, style etc strictly" (sent while first agent was running)
   - (Approved the plan when ExitPlanMode was called)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 4 (IN PROGRESS)**: Wire up hook handlers and imports — need to:
     1. Add `RegisterHookHandler` call for Codex `agent-turn-complete` in `hook_registry.go` init()
     2. Update `getHookType()` in `hook_registry.go` to include `codex.HookNameAgentTurnComplete`
     3. Create `hooks_codex_handlers.go` with `handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()` function
   - **Task 5 (PENDING)**: Run `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`

8. Current Work:
   I was in the middle of Task 4 "Wire up hook handlers and imports". I had just:
   - Updated `hooks_cmd.go` with blank imports for codex and opencode
   - Added the codex import to `hook_registry.go`
   
   I still need to complete three things in Task 4:
   1. Add the `RegisterHookHandler` call for `agent.AgentNameCodex` / `codex.HookNameAgentTurnComplete` in the `init()` function of `hook_registry.go`
   2. Update `getHookType()` switch statement to handle `codex.HookNameAgentTurnComplete` (return "agent")
   3. Create `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_codex_handlers.go` with the `handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()` handler function (analogous to `handleGeminiAfterAgent()` in `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go`)

9. Optional Next Step:
   Complete Task 4 by:
   1. Adding the Codex hook handler registration in `hook_registry.go` init():
   ```go
   RegisterHookHandler(agent.AgentNameCodex, codex.HookNameAgentTurnComplete, func() error {
       enabled, err := IsEnabled()
       if err == nil && !enabled {
           return nil
       }
       return handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()
   })
   ```
   2. Updating `getHookType()` to include codex hook name
   3. Creating `hooks_codex_handlers.go` with the handler that parses the Codex notify JSON payload and commits session changes (following the pattern from `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` `handleGeminiAfterAgent()`)
   4. Then run Task 5: `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test:ci`

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial context**: This session is a continuation from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary from the previous session indicates the user asked to "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex" with emphasis on following coding guidelines strictly. A detailed plan was created and approved, and implementation was mostly complete.

2. **Session start**: The conversation resumed with the previous session's context loaded, including:
   - Tasks 1-3 completed (constants, OpenCode package, Codex package)
   - Task 4 (wire up hook handlers) was in progress
   - Task 5 (run fmt/lint/tests) was pending
   - Three specific items remained for Task 4

3. **Completing Task 4**: I read the current state of hook_registry.go, hooks_geminicli_handlers.go, and hooks_claudecode_handlers.go for reference patterns. Then I:
   - Added `RegisterHookHandler` for Codex in hook_registry.go init()
   - Verified getHookType() didn't need changes (default "agent" covers codex)
   - Created hooks_codex_handlers.go with the full Codex handler

4. **Task 5 - fmt/lint/tests**:
   - `mise run fmt` - needed `mise trust` first, then formatted successfully (gofmt fixed struct alignment)
   - `mise run lint` - failed with type error: `agent.Get()` expects `AgentName` not `string`
   - Fixed: changed `agent.Get(string(agent.AgentNameCodex))` to `agent.Get(agent.AgentNameCodex)`
   - `mise run lint` - passed (0 issues)
   - `mise run test` - failed: two `TestGetSessionDir` tests used `t.Parallel()` with `t.Setenv()`
   - Fixed: removed `t.Parallel()` from both codex and opencode TestGetSessionDir tests
   - `mise run test` - all packages pass
   - Final `mise run fmt && mise run lint` - clean

5. **User asked to commit and create PR**:
   - Created branch `add-opencode-codex-agent-support`
   - Staged only relevant files (excluded unrelated strategy nolint changes and data/docs dirs)
   - Committed with descriptive message
   - Pushed and created PR against upstream (entireio/cli #248)

6. **User asked to create PR against fork**:
   - Closed upstream PR #248
   - Created PR against Avyukth/cli as PR #1

7. **User asked to run integration tests**:
   - `mise run test:integration` - passed (54.6s)

8. **User asked for manual verification**:
   - Built CLI binary
   - `entire enable --agent opencode` → "agent opencode does not support hooks" (exit 1) ✓
   - `entire enable --agent codex` → Installed 1 hook, created `.codex/config.toml` ✓
   - `entire hooks codex agent-turn-complete` → Handler invoked, failed at transcript copy (expected) ✓

9. **User challenged OpenCode "no hooks" assertion**: User said to check actual codebases at `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode` and `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/codex` to understand what they actually support.

10. **Deep exploration of actual codebases**: Launched two parallel Explore agents:
    - **OpenCode**: Found it has a RICH plugin/hook system with event subscriptions, tool hooks, session lifecycle events, BunShell for spawning commands
    - **Codex**: Confirmed single `notify` hook for `agent-turn-complete`, payload structure matches implementation

11. **Entered plan mode**: To redesign OpenCode from "no hooks" to full plugin-based hook support. Launched two more explore agents to understand:
    - OpenCode plugin file format, event types, shell access patterns
    - Existing Claude/Gemini InstallHooks patterns for reference

12. **User asked to check PR bot comments**: Read CodeRabbit review on PR #1 which had:
    - 6 actionable comments (bugs/improvements)
    - 10 nitpick comments
    - Key issues: WriteSession missing parent dir creation, GetTranscriptPosition off-by-one, ResolveSessionFile glob pattern doesn't work recursively, force install creates duplicate TOML keys, userPrompt not set in codex handler context, isEntireNotifyLine false positives, redundant presence check, duplicated file extraction logic

13. **Current state**: In plan mode, have completed Phase 1 exploration for the OpenCode hooks redesign. The plan file at `/Users/amrit/.claude/plans/compressed-purring-cloud.md` exists from the original planning session but needs to be overwritten with the new plan. Also need to address CodeRabbit review feedback.

Key user messages:
- "commit and create pr"
- "create against fork"
- "run the integration tests"
- "run Manual: ... should show agent doesn't support hooks / should install notify hook / should invoke the handler"
- "what it supports... do that in case of doubt check the code base /Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode, /Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/codex"
- "check the bot comment https://github.com/Avyukth/cli/pull/1"

The pending work involves TWO major streams:
1. Redesigning OpenCode to support hooks via plugin system (currently in plan mode)
2. Addressing CodeRabbit review feedback (6 actionable + 10 nitpick comments)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - **Original request**: "Go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex" with emphasis on strictly following coding guidelines
   - **Follow-up**: Commit changes, create PR against fork (Avyukth/cli), run integration tests, run manual verification
   - **Critical correction**: User challenged the OpenCode "no hooks" implementation, pointing to actual codebases at `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode` and `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/codex` to verify hook capabilities
   - **Latest request**: Check CodeRabbit bot review comments on PR #1

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Agent plugin architecture**: Agents self-register via `init()` using `agent.Register(name, factory)`, implement `Agent` interface, optionally `HookSupport`, `HookHandler`, `TranscriptAnalyzer`, `TranscriptChunker`
   - **Hook registry pattern**: Handlers registered in `hook_registry.go` init() to avoid circular dependencies
   - **OpenCode plugin system**: Rich TypeScript/Bun plugin system with event subscriptions (`session.idle`, `session.created`, `session.status`), tool hooks (`tool.execute.before/after`), BunShell (`Analysis:

) for spawning external commands. Plugins installed as `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts` files or via `opencode.json` config
   - **Codex CLI notify hook**: Single `notify` command in `.codex/config.toml` triggered on `agent-turn-complete`. JSON payload with `type`, `thread-id`, `turn-id`, `cwd`, `input-messages`, `last-assistant-message`
   - **TOML manipulation without library**: String-based TOML editing for Codex config (no TOML library in go.mod)
   - **Test parallelization rules**: `t.Parallel()` cannot be used with `t.Setenv()` or `t.Chdir()` (Go panics)

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/registry.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added 4 new constants for Codex and OpenCode agent names/types
     ```go
     AgentNameCodex    AgentName = "codex"
     AgentNameOpenCode AgentName = "opencode"
     AgentTypeCodex    AgentType = "Codex CLI"
     AgentTypeOpenCode AgentType = "OpenCode"
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode.go`** (NEW - ~192 lines)
     - Full Agent interface implementation. Currently `SupportsHooks()` returns `false` — THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE based on actual OpenCode codebase having rich plugin system
     - DetectPresence checks `.opencode/`, `opencode.json`, `opencode.jsonc`
     - GetSessionDir uses XDG_DATA_HOME (`~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/`)
     - FormatResumeCommand returns `"opencode run --session " + sessionID`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/types.go`** (NEW)
     - Tool constants: `ToolWrite`, `ToolEdit`, `ToolApplyPatch`, `ToolMultiEdit`
     - `FileModificationTools` slice (CodeRabbit suggested making immutable via function)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode_test.go`** (NEW - ~201 lines)
     - Tests for all Agent methods. DetectPresence tests not parallel (use `t.Chdir()`). GetSessionDir not parallel (uses `t.Setenv()`)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/codex.go`** (NEW - ~413 lines)
     - Full Agent, TranscriptAnalyzer, TranscriptChunker implementation
     - ParseHookInput parses JSON notify payload
     - GetSessionDir respects `CODEX_HOME`, defaults to `~/.codex/sessions/`
     - ExtractModifiedFiles parses JSONL for `file_change` items
     - CodeRabbit found: redundant DetectPresence check, GetTranscriptPosition off-by-one, ResolveSessionFile `**` glob doesn't work with filepath.Glob, duplicated file extraction logic, WriteSession missing parent dir creation, SessionRef set to directory not file

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/types.go`** (NEW - ~38 lines)
     - `notifyPayload` (hyphenated JSON keys), `rolloutEvent`/`rolloutItem` (underscored keys)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/hooks.go`** (NEW - ~229 lines)
     - HookSupport + HookHandler interfaces, single hook `agent-turn-complete`
     - InstallHooks creates/modifies `.codex/config.toml` with `notify = ["entire", "hooks", "codex", "agent-turn-complete"]`
     - CodeRabbit found: force=true creates duplicate TOML keys, `isEntireNotifyLine` false positives on substrings

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/codex_test.go`** (NEW - ~408 lines)
     - Comprehensive tests. TestGetSessionDir fixed to not use t.Parallel() with t.Setenv()

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hook_registry.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added import for codex package
     - Added RegisterHookHandler for Codex `agent-turn-complete`:
     ```go
     RegisterHookHandler(agent.AgentNameCodex, codex.HookNameAgentTurnComplete, func() error {
         enabled, err := IsEnabled()
         if err == nil && !enabled {
             return nil
         }
         return handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()
     })
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_cmd.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added blank imports for codex and opencode packages

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_codex_handlers.go`** (NEW - ~252 lines)
     - `handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()` — parses notify, resolves transcript, creates session dir, extracts metadata, commits via strategy, transitions session state
     - `codexSessionContext` struct, `setupCodexSessionDir`, `extractCodexMetadata`, `commitCodexSession`, `createContextFileForCodex`
     - CodeRabbit found: `userPrompt` not set from `input.UserPrompt`, transcript copied then re-read redundantly

   - **Reference files read** (not modified):
     - `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` — reference pattern for handler implementation
     - `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` — reference pattern for commitWithMetadata flow
     - `state.go` — PrePromptState, DetectFileChanges, FilterAndNormalizePaths
     - `hooks.go` — handleSessionStartCommon, hook input parsing types

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - **`mise trust` needed**: `mise run fmt` failed with untrusted config. Fixed by running `mise trust` first.
   - **Type error in agent.Get()**: `agent.Get(string(agent.AgentNameCodex))` — `string()` conversion returns `string` type which doesn't auto-convert back to `AgentName`. Fixed: changed to `agent.Get(agent.AgentNameCodex)`.
   - **t.Parallel() + t.Setenv() panic**: Both codex and opencode `TestGetSessionDir` tests used `t.Parallel()` on parent/subtests with `t.Setenv()`. Go panics on this combination. Fixed: removed `t.Parallel()` from both tests, added comment explaining why.
   - **OpenCode hooks incorrectly marked as unsupported**: User corrected that OpenCode has a rich plugin/hook system. The actual codebase at `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode` shows TypeScript plugins with event hooks, tool hooks, session lifecycle events, and BunShell for spawning commands. This is a significant design error that needs fixing.
   - **CodeRabbit review findings** (6 actionable, 10 nitpick): Multiple bugs and improvements identified — see pending tasks.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully implemented both agent packages following existing patterns (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)
   - All tests pass, lint clean, integration tests pass
   - Manual verification confirmed: Codex hooks install correctly, OpenCode correctly reports no hooks (but this is WRONG per actual codebase)
   - PR created at https://github.com/Avyukth/cli/pull/1
   - Two major issues discovered requiring follow-up work: OpenCode needs hooks via plugin system, CodeRabbit review has valid bug reports

6. All User Messages:
   - (From previous session) "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex"
   - (From previous session) "understand coding guideline stick to its coding guidelines, style etc strictly"
   - "commit and create pr"
   - "create against fork"
   - "run the integration tests"
   - "run Manual: `$(entire enable --agent opencode)` should show agent doesn't support hooks / Manual: `$(entire enable --agent codex)` should install notify hook / Manual: `$(entire hooks codex agent-turn-complete)` should invoke the handler"
   - "what it supports... `entire enable --agent opencode` → 'agent opencode does not support hooks' (exit 1) ? do that in case of doubt check the code base /Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode, /Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/codex"
   - "check the bot comment https://github.com/Avyukth/cli/pull/1"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **OpenCode hooks redesign** (IN PLAN MODE): OpenCode actually HAS a rich plugin system. Need to:
     - Change `SupportsHooks()` to return `true`
     - Implement `HookHandler` interface with hook names (session-start, session-idle/stop, etc.)
     - Implement `HookSupport` (InstallHooks creates `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts` plugin file, AreHooksInstalled checks plugin exists, UninstallHooks removes it)
     - Create `hooks_opencode_handlers.go` with handler implementations
     - Register hook handlers in `hook_registry.go`
   - **CodeRabbit review fixes** (6 actionable items):
     1. `codex/codex.go` WriteSession: create parent dir before writing
     2. `codex/codex.go` GetTranscriptPosition: off-by-one for final partial line
     3. `codex/codex.go` ResolveSessionFile: `**` glob doesn't work with filepath.Glob, need filepath.WalkDir
     4. `codex/hooks.go` InstallHooks: force=true creates duplicate TOML notify keys
     5. `opencode/opencode.go` WriteSession: create parent dir before writing
     6. `hooks_codex_handlers.go`: set `userPrompt` from `input.UserPrompt` on context creation
   - **CodeRabbit nitpick fixes** (10 items): immutable FileModificationTools, test coverage gap, JSON tag comment, isEntireNotifyLine false positives, redundant DetectPresence check, duplicated file extraction logic, etc.

8. Current Work:
   I am currently **in plan mode** designing the OpenCode hooks implementation. Phase 1 exploration is complete — two Explore agents returned comprehensive findings about:
   - OpenCode's plugin system (TypeScript plugins, event hooks, BunShell for spawning commands)
   - Existing Claude/Gemini InstallHooks patterns for reference
   
   I had also just read the CodeRabbit review comments from the PR. The plan file at `/Users/amrit/.claude/plans/compressed-purring-cloud.md` needs to be overwritten with the new plan for OpenCode hooks + CodeRabbit fixes.

   The user's most recent request was "check the bot comment https://github.com/Avyukth/cli/pull/1" which I completed by reading all CodeRabbit review comments.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue in plan mode — write the updated plan to the plan file covering:
   1. OpenCode hooks redesign (plugin-based, creating `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts`)
   2. CodeRabbit review fixes (6 actionable + relevant nitpicks)
   Then call ExitPlanMode for user approval.
   
   This aligns with the user's explicit correction: "what it supports... do that in case of doubt check the code base" — the user wants OpenCode to properly support hooks based on its actual plugin system capabilities.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/amrit/.REDACTED.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This is a continuation from TWO previous conversations. The first session implemented OpenCode and Codex agent support. The second session continued that work, completed implementation, created a PR, and then discovered that OpenCode was incorrectly implemented as "no hooks" when it actually has a rich plugin system. The user also asked to check CodeRabbit review comments.

2. **This Session Start**: The conversation resumed with plan mode active. The previous plan file existed at `/Users/amrit/.claude/plans/compressed-purring-cloud.md` with the original (now outdated) plan.

3. **Phase 1 - Reading current state**: I read multiple files to understand the current implementation:
   - `opencode/opencode.go` - Current OpenCode agent (SupportsHooks=false)
   - `opencode/types.go` - Tool constants, mutable FileModificationTools var
   - `codex/codex.go` - Codex agent with multiple bugs
   - `codex/hooks.go` - Codex hook support with bugs
   - `hooks_codex_handlers.go` - Codex hook handler with userPrompt bug
   - `agent/agent.go` - Agent, HookSupport, HookHandler interfaces
   - `hook_registry.go` - Hook registration pattern
   - `geminicli/hooks.go` - Reference for plugin-based hook installation
   - `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` - Reference for handler pattern
   - `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - Reference for handler pattern

4. **Phase 1 - Exploration agents**: Launched two Explore agents in parallel:
   - OpenCode plugin system exploration: Found rich TypeScript plugin system with event subscriptions, BunShell, `.opencode/plugins/*.{ts,js}` auto-discovery
   - Codex CLI verification: Confirmed single `notify` hook, UUID v7 thread-id, rollout format uses `response_item` not `file_change`

5. **Phase 2 - Plan writing**: Wrote comprehensive plan covering:
   - Part 1: OpenCode hook support via plugin system (5 sub-tasks)
   - Part 2: CodeRabbit bug fixes (10 items)

6. **Phase 3 - ExitPlanMode**: User approved the plan.

7. **Implementation started**: Created task list (Tasks 6-9) and began implementing.

8. **Task 6 - OpenCode hook support** (COMPLETED):
   - Modified `opencode/opencode.go`:
     - Changed `SupportsHooks()` to return `true`
     - Updated `GetHookConfigPath()` to return `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts`
     - Replaced `ParseHookInput()` with full implementation parsing JSON from stdin
     - Added `os.MkdirAll` before WriteSession (CodeRabbit fix 2.1)
     - Added `time` import
   - Modified `opencode/types.go`:
     - Changed `FileModificationTools` from `var` slice to function (CodeRabbit fix 2.9)
     - Added `pluginPayload` struct
   - Created `opencode/hooks.go` (NEW):
     - HookSupport + HookHandler interface assertions
     - Hook constants: `HookNameSessionCreated`, `HookNameSessionIdle`
     - `EntirePluginFileName = "entire.ts"`
     - `entirePluginMarker` for identifying Entire-generated plugins
     - `InstallHooks()` - creates `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts` TypeScript plugin
     - `UninstallHooks()` - removes plugin (only if it has Entire marker)
     - `AreHooksInstalled()` - checks for marker
     - `entirePluginContent()` - generates TypeScript plugin source
   - Rewrote `opencode/opencode_test.go`:
     - Changed `TestSupportsHooks_ReturnsFalse` → `TestSupportsHooks` (expects true)
     - Removed `TestParseHookInput_ReturnsError`
     - Added: `TestParseHookInput_SessionIdle`, `TestParseHookInput_SessionCreated`, `TestParseHookInput_EmptyInput`
     - Added: `TestInstallHooks` (4 subtests), `TestAreHooksInstalled` (3 subtests), `TestUninstallHooks` (3 subtests)
     - Added: `TestGetHookNames`, `TestGetSupportedHooks`, `TestGetHookConfigPath`, `TestWriteSession_CreatesParentDir`

9. **Task 7 - Register handlers** (IN PROGRESS):
   - Modified `hook_registry.go`:
     - Added import for `opencode` package
     - Added two `RegisterHookHandler` calls for OpenCode (session-created, session-idle)
   - Created `hooks_opencode_handlers.go` (NEW):
     - `handleOpenCodeSessionCreated()` - delegates to `handleSessionStartCommon()`
     - `handleOpenCodeSessionIdle()` - parses input, resolves transcript, commits session
     - `openCodeSessionContext` struct
     - `setupOpenCodeSessionDir()`, `commitOpenCodeSession()`, `createContextFileForOpenCode()`

10. **Task 8 - CodeRabbit fixes** (IN PROGRESS, partially done):
    - Fix 2.1: Added `os.MkdirAll` to both WriteSession methods ✓ (done in both opencode and codex)
    - Fix 2.2: Fixed GetTranscriptPosition off-by-one ✓
    - Fix 2.3: Fixed ResolveSessionFile `**` glob with filepath.WalkDir ✓
    - Fix 2.5: Set userPrompt in codex handler - NOT YET DONE
    - Fix 2.6: Removed redundant DetectPresence check ✓
    - Fix 2.7: Extracted shared helper `extractFilePathFromLine` ✓
    - Fix 2.8: isEntireNotifyLine false positives - NOT YET DONE
    - Fix 2.9: FileModificationTools immutability ✓
    - Fix 2.10: Updated rollout types ✓
    - Fix 2.4: force=true duplicate TOML keys - NOT YET DONE

The session was interrupted right in the middle of implementing Task 8 (CodeRabbit fixes). Three fixes remain: 2.4, 2.5, and 2.8.

Let me also check: the `strings` import might be needed in codex.go since we added `strings.Contains` and `strings.HasSuffix` in ResolveSessionFile. Let me verify - yes, `strings` is already imported in codex.go.

The hooks_opencode_handlers.go uses `changes.Modified` from `FileChanges` struct which does exist.

Let me verify what files were changed but NOT yet written/saved:
- hooks_codex_handlers.go fix 2.5 (userPrompt) - NOT YET DONE
- codex/hooks.go fix 2.4 (force duplicates) and 2.8 (isEntireNotifyLine) - NOT YET DONE

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's original request (from previous sessions) was to "go through the code base totally and add support for opencode and codex" with emphasis on strictly following coding guidelines. After the initial implementation was PR'd (Avyukth/cli#1), the user corrected that OpenCode was incorrectly implemented as "no hooks" — pointing to actual codebases at `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/opencode` and `/Users/amrit/Documents/Projects/Rust/mouchak/codex`. The user also asked to check CodeRabbit bot review comments on the PR. This session continues the redesign of OpenCode to support hooks via its plugin system, plus fixing all CodeRabbit review issues.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Agent plugin architecture**: Agents self-register via `init()` using `agent.Register(name, factory)`, implement `Agent` interface, optionally `HookSupport`, `HookHandler`, `TranscriptAnalyzer`, `TranscriptChunker`
   - **OpenCode plugin system**: TypeScript plugins auto-discovered from `.opencode/plugins/*.{ts,js}`. Plugin exports async function receiving `PluginInput` (includes `Analysis:

 BunShell for spawning commands) and returns `Hooks` object with event subscribers
   - **OpenCode events**: `session.created`, `session.status` (idle/busy/retry), `session.idle`, `session.diff`, `tool.execute.before/after`
   - **Codex CLI notify hook**: Single `notify` command in `.codex/config.toml` triggered on `agent-turn-complete`. JSON payload with `type`, `thread-id` (UUID v7), `turn-id`, `cwd`, `input-messages`, `last-assistant-message`
   - **Codex rollout format**: JSONL with typed events: `session_meta`, `response_item`, `turn_context`, `compacted`, `event_msg`. File changes are in `function_call` and `local_shell_call` content, NOT separate `file_change` items at top level
   - **Hook registry pattern**: Handlers registered in `hook_registry.go` init() to avoid circular dependencies
   - **TOML manipulation**: String-based TOML editing for Codex config (no TOML library in go.mod)
   - **Test parallelization**: `t.Parallel()` cannot be used with `t.Setenv()` or `t.Chdir()` (Go panics)
   - **Strategy pattern**: `Strategy` interface in `strategy.go` with `SaveChanges()` accepting `SaveContext`
   - **FileChanges struct**: Has `Modified`, `New`, `Deleted` fields from `DetectFileChanges()`

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Core OpenCode agent implementation. Changed from "no hooks" to full hook support.
     - `SupportsHooks()` now returns `true`
     - `GetHookConfigPath()` returns `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts`
     - `ParseHookInput()` now fully implemented to parse JSON plugin payloads
     - `WriteSession()` now creates parent directory before writing
     - Key new code in ParseHookInput:
     ```go
     func (o *OpenCodeAgent) ParseHookInput(hookType agent.HookType, reader io.Reader) (*agent.HookInput, error) {
         data, err := io.ReadAll(reader)
         if err != nil {
             return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read input: %w", err)
         }
         if len(data) == 0 {
             return nil, errors.New("empty input")
         }
         input := &agent.HookInput{
             HookType:  hookType,
             Timestamp: time.Now(),
             RawData:   make(map[string]interface{}),
         }
         var payload pluginPayload
         if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &payload); err != nil {
             return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse plugin payload: %w", err)
         }
         input.SessionID = payload.SessionID
         input.RawData["type"] = payload.Type
         sessionDir, dirErr := o.GetSessionDir("")
         if dirErr == nil && input.SessionID != "" {
             input.SessionRef = o.ResolveSessionFile(sessionDir, o.ExtractAgentSessionID(input.SessionID))
         }
         return input, nil
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/hooks.go`** (NEW)
     - HookSupport + HookHandler implementations for OpenCode via TypeScript plugin system
     - Installs `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts` which subscribes to `session.created` and `session.status` (idle) events
     - Uses BunShell to pipe JSON to `entire hooks opencode <hook-name>`
     - Key constants: `HookNameSessionCreated = "session-created"`, `HookNameSessionIdle = "session-idle"`, `EntirePluginFileName = "entire.ts"`, `entirePluginMarker = "// Generated by Entire CLI — do not edit manually"`
     - `InstallHooks()` checks idempotency, generates plugin via `entirePluginContent(localDev)`, returns 2 (hooks count)
     - `UninstallHooks()` only removes file if it contains the Entire marker
     - `AreHooksInstalled()` checks for marker in plugin file
     - `entirePluginContent(localDev bool) string` generates the TypeScript plugin source

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/types.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Changed `FileModificationTools` from mutable `var` to function returning new slice
     - Added `pluginPayload` struct for JSON deserialization:
     ```go
     type pluginPayload struct {
         Type      string `json:"type"`
         SessionID string `json:"sessionID"`
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/opencode/opencode_test.go`** (REWRITTEN)
     - Updated `TestSupportsHooks` to expect `true`
     - Removed `TestParseHookInput_ReturnsError`
     - Added: `TestParseHookInput_SessionIdle`, `TestParseHookInput_SessionCreated`, `TestParseHookInput_EmptyInput`
     - Added: `TestInstallHooks` (4 subtests: installs, idempotent, local dev, force reinstall)
     - Added: `TestAreHooksInstalled` (3 subtests: not installed, installed, non-entire plugin)
     - Added: `TestUninstallHooks` (3 subtests: uninstalls, no file, does not remove non-entire)
     - Added: `TestGetHookNames`, `TestGetSupportedHooks`, `TestGetHookConfigPath`, `TestWriteSession_CreatesParentDir`

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hook_registry.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added import for `opencode` package
     - Added two RegisterHookHandler calls:
     ```go
     RegisterHookHandler(agent.AgentNameOpenCode, opencode.HookNameSessionCreated, func() error {
         enabled, err := IsEnabled()
         if err == nil && !enabled { return nil }
         return handleOpenCodeSessionCreated()
     })
     RegisterHookHandler(agent.AgentNameOpenCode, opencode.HookNameSessionIdle, func() error {
         enabled, err := IsEnabled()
         if err == nil && !enabled { return nil }
         return handleOpenCodeSessionIdle()
     })
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/hooks_opencode_handlers.go`** (NEW)
     - `handleOpenCodeSessionCreated()` delegates to `handleSessionStartCommon()`
     - `handleOpenCodeSessionIdle()` parses input, resolves transcript, commits session
     - Uses `changes.Modified` from `DetectFileChanges()` since OpenCode doesn't have transcript-based file extraction
     - Pattern follows `handleGeminiAfterAgent()` / `handleCodexAgentTurnComplete()`
     - Key struct:
     ```go
     type openCodeSessionContext struct {
         sessionID, transcriptPath, sessionDir, sessionDirAbs, userPrompt, commitMessage string
     }
     ```

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/codex.go`** (MODIFIED - multiple CodeRabbit fixes)
     - Fix 2.1: Added `os.MkdirAll(filepath.Dir(session.SessionRef), 0o750)` before WriteSession
     - Fix 2.2: Fixed GetTranscriptPosition off-by-one — now counts partial final lines without trailing newline
     - Fix 2.3: Replaced `filepath.Glob` with `filepath.WalkDir` for recursive session file search
     - Fix 2.6: Removed redundant `.codex/config.toml` check in DetectPresence (if `.codex` dir doesn't exist, config inside won't either)
     - Fix 2.7: Extracted shared `extractFilePathFromLine()` helper, refactored both `ExtractModifiedFilesFromOffset` and `ExtractModifiedFiles` to use it. Also added `extractFilePathFromFunctionCall()` for `function_call` items
     - Added `strings` usage in ResolveSessionFile (already imported)

   - **`cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/types.go`** (MODIFIED)
     - Added `Payload` field to `rolloutEvent` struct
     - Added `Name` field to `rolloutItem` struct
     - Added new item type constants: `ItemTypeFunctionCall`, `ItemTypeLocalShellCall`
     - Updated doc comments to list known rollout types

   - **Reference files read** (not modified this session):
     - `agent/agent.go` - Agent, HookSupport, HookHandler, TranscriptAnalyzer, TranscriptChunker interfaces
     - `geminicli/hooks.go` - Reference for InstallHooks pattern (JSON settings.json manipulation)
     - `hooks_geminicli_handlers.go` - Reference for handler pattern (session start, after-agent, etc.)
     - `hooks_claudecode_handlers.go` - Reference for parseAndLogHookInput, captureInitialState patterns
     - `strategy/manual_commit.go`, `strategy/registry.go` - Strategy pattern reference
     - `codex/codex_test.go` - Current test file (to understand existing tests)
     - `codex/hooks.go` - Current hooks implementation (bugs to fix)
     - `hooks_codex_handlers.go` - Current handler (userPrompt bug)

4. Errors and Fixes:
   - No runtime errors encountered in this session yet (haven't run fmt/lint/test yet)
   - **Previous session errors** (documented in context):
     - `mise trust` needed before `mise run fmt`
     - Type error: `agent.Get(string(agent.AgentNameCodex))` — fixed to `agent.Get(agent.AgentNameCodex)`
     - `t.Parallel()` + `t.Setenv()` panic — removed `t.Parallel()` from affected tests
     - OpenCode incorrectly marked as "no hooks" — user corrected this, leading to current redesign

5. Problem Solving:
   - Redesigned OpenCode from "no hooks" to full plugin-based hook support using TypeScript plugin at `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts`
   - Fixed 7 out of 10 CodeRabbit review items so far
   - Used `filepath.WalkDir` instead of `filepath.Glob` to fix `**` pattern not working
   - Extracted shared `extractFilePathFromLine` helper to eliminate code duplication between `ExtractModifiedFilesFromOffset` and `ExtractModifiedFiles`
   - Added `function_call` parsing alongside `file_change` to match actual Codex rollout format

6. All User Messages:
   - "Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on." (session continuation message)
   - The user approved the plan via ExitPlanMode (implicit approval)

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 7** (IN PROGRESS): Register OpenCode handlers — hook_registry.go and hooks_opencode_handlers.go are DONE
   - **Task 8** (IN PROGRESS): Three CodeRabbit fixes remain:
     - Fix 2.4: `codex/hooks.go` — InstallHooks force=true creates duplicate TOML notify keys. When `force=true`, should also remove ALL existing notify lines (not just Entire ones)
     - Fix 2.5: `hooks_codex_handlers.go:61-64` — Set `userPrompt: input.UserPrompt` in codexSessionContext creation
     - Fix 2.8: `codex/hooks.go:198-205` — `isEntireNotifyLine` false positives. Check for `"entire"` (with quotes) instead of bare `entire` substring
   - **Task 9** (PENDING): Run `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test && mise run test:integration`
   - After tests pass: commit, push to PR branch

8. Current Work:
   I was actively implementing CodeRabbit bug fixes (Task 8) and had just finished:
   - Fix 2.1 (WriteSession parent dir) for both agents
   - Fix 2.2 (GetTranscriptPosition off-by-one)
   - Fix 2.3 (ResolveSessionFile filepath.WalkDir)
   - Fix 2.6 (redundant DetectPresence)
   - Fix 2.7 (deduplicated file extraction)
   - Fix 2.9 (FileModificationTools immutability)
   - Fix 2.10 (rollout types)
   
   Three fixes remain in Task 8, then Task 9 (verification).

9. Optional Next Step:
   Continue implementing the remaining 3 CodeRabbit fixes:
   1. Fix 2.4 in `cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/hooks.go` — fix force=true duplicate TOML keys
   2. Fix 2.5 in `cmd/entire/cli/hooks_codex_handlers.go` — add `userPrompt: input.UserPrompt` to codexSessionContext
   3. Fix 2.8 in `cmd/entire/cli/agent/codex/hooks.go` — fix isEntireNotifyLine false positives
   
   Then run `mise run fmt && mise run lint && mise run test && mise run test:integration` (Task 9).
   
   This directly continues the approved plan implementation. The last edits made were to `codex/types.go` (updated rollout types) and `codex/codex.go` (extracted shared helper), both part of Task 8.
